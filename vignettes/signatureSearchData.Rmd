# Introduction

The `signatureSearchData` package provides access to the reference data used by
the associated `signatureSearch` software package. The latter allows to search 
with a query gene expression signature a database of treatment signatures to 
identify cellular states with similar expression responses (connections). This 
way one can identify drugs or gene knockouts that induce expression phenotypes 
similar to a sample of interest. The resulting associations may lead to novel 
functional insights how perturbagens of interest interact with biological systems. 
Currently, `signatureSearchData` includes
gene expression data from the CMap (Connectivity Map) and LINCS (Library of
Network-Based Cellular Signatures) projects that are largely based on drug and
genetic perturbation experiments performed on variable numbers of human cell
lines [@Lamb2006-du; @Subramanian2017-fu]. In `signatureSearchData` these data sets 
are preprocessed as needed by the gene expression signature search (GESS)
algorithms implemented and used by `signatureSearch`. The preprocessed data
types include but are not limited to normalized gene expression values 
(_e.g._ intensity values), log fold changes (LFC) and Z-scores, P or FDR values 
for DEG calls, rankings based on selected preprocessing routines or sets of 
top up/down-regulated DEGs. 

The CMap data were downloaded from the [CMap project
site](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/cmap/) (Version CMAP2). The latter is
a collection of over 7,000 gene expression profiles (signatures) obtained
from perturbation experiments with 1,309 drug-like small molecules on five
human cancer cell lines. The Affymetrix Gene Chip technology was used to
generate the CMAP2 data set. 

In 2017, the LINCS Consortium generated a similar but much larger data set where
the total number of gene expression signatures was scaled up to over one
million. This was achieved by switching to a much more cost effective gene
expression profiling technology called L1000 assay [@Peck2006-rf;
@Edgar2002-di]. The current set of perturbations covered by the LINCS data set
includes 19,811 drug-like small molecules applied at varialbe concentrations
and treatment times to 70 human non-cancer (normal) and cancer cell lines.
Additionally, it includes several thousand genetic perturbagens composed of
gene knockdown and over-expression experiments. 

The data structures and search algorithms used by `signatureSearch` and
`signatureSearchData` are designed to work with most genome-wide expression
data including hybridization-based methods, such as Affymetrix or L1000, as
well as sequencing-based methods, such as RNA-Seq. Currently,
`signatureSearchData` does not include RNA-Seq data mainly due to the lack
of large-scale perturbation studies (_e.g._ drug-based) available in the public
domain that are based on RNA-Seq. This situation may change in the near future
once the cost of RNA-Seq becomes more cost effective for this purpose. 


# Install and load `signatureSearchData`

`signatureSearch` is a R/Bioconductor package and can be installed using 
`BiocManager::install()`.
```{r install, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("signatureSearchData", version = "3.9")
```

After the package is installed, it can be loaded in an R session as follows.
```{r load, eval=FALSE}
library(signatureSearchData)
```

# LINCS signature database
The L1000 assay, used for generating the LINCS data, measures the expression 
of 978 landmark genes and 80 control genes by loading amplified mRNA populations 
onto beads and then detecting their abundance with a fluorescent-based method [@Peck2006-rf]. 
The expression of 11,350 additional genes is imputed from the landmark genes by using 
as training data a large collection of Affymetrix gene chips [@Edgar2002-di].

The LINCS data are pre-processed by the Broad Institute to 5 different levels
and are available for download from GEO. Level 1 data are the raw mean
fluorescent intensity values that come directly from the Luminex scanner. Level
2 data are the expression intensities of the 978 landmark genes. They have been
normalized and used to impute the expression of the additional 11,350 genes,
forming Level 3 data. A robust z-scoring procedure was used to generate
differential expression values from the normalized profiles (Level 4).
Finally, a moderated z-scoring procedure was applied to the replicated samples
of each experiment (mostly 3 replicates) to compute a weighted average
signature (Level 5). For a more detailed description of the preprocessing
methods used by the LINCS project, readers want to refer to the [LINCS user
guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q2gciWRhVCAAnlvF2iRLuJ7whrGP6QjpsCMq1yWz7dU/edit#).

Disregarding replicates, the LINCS data set contains 473,647 signatures with
unique cell type and treatment combinations. This includes 19,811 drug-like
small molecules tested on different cell lines at multiple concentrations and
treatment times. In additon to compounds, several thousand genetic
perturbations (gene knock-downs and over expressions) have been tested.
Currently, the data described in this vignette are restricted to signatures of
small molecule treatments across different cells lines. For consistency, only
signatures at one specific concentration (10um) and one time point (24h) have
been selected for each small molecule. These choices are similar to the
conditions used in primary high-throughput compound screens of cell lines.
Since the selected compound concentations and treatment durations have not been
tested by LINCS across all cell types yet, a subset of compounds had to be
selected that best met the chosen treatment requirements. This left us with 8,104
compounds that were uniformly tested at the chosen concentration and treatment time, but
across variable numbers of cell lines. The total number of expression signatures
meeing this requirement is 45,956, while the total number of cell lines included 
in this data set is 30. 

## Load from `AnnotationHub`

The sub-dataset from LINCS that was filtered and assembled according to the above steps can be loaded 
through the `AnnotationHub` interface as follows. 


```{r lincs, eval=FALSE}
library(AnnotationHub); library(rhdf5)
ah <- AnnotationHub()
query(ah, c("signatureSearchData", "lincs"))
lincs_db_path <- ah[['AH69092']]
h5ls(lincs_db_path)
```

In summary, the loaded data instance includes moderated z-scores from a DE
analysis outcomes of 12,328 genes of 8,140 compound treatments across a total
of 30 cell lines. This data set can be used by all GESS methods provided by the
`signatureSearch` package.

## Generate from the original resources

The following steps explain how to generate the above data set from scratch. This also
illustrates how to filter the LINCS data in other ways.

<font color="blue">[Is this correct?]</font>

### Download the LINCS Level5 datasets at GEO 

Download and unzip the following files from GEO entry [GSE92742](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE92742):

+ GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_Level5_COMPZ.MODZ_n473647x12328.gctx.gz
+ GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_gene_info.txt.gz
+ GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_sig_info.txt.gz

The following code examples assume that the downloaded datasets are stored in a
sub-directory called `data`.  All paths in this vignette are given relative to
the present working directory of the userâ€™s R session.

### Filter signatures 

Selecting LINCS level5 signatures of compound treatments at 10 uM concentration 
and 24 h duration.
```{r filter_meta42, eval=FALSE}
## ignore warning message
meta42 <- readr::read_tsv("./data/GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_sig_info.txt") 
dose <- meta42$pert_idose[7]
## filter rows by 'pert_type' as compound, 10 uM concentration, and 24 h treatment time
meta42_filter <- sig_filter(meta42, pert_type="trt_cp", dose=dose, time="24 h") # 45956 X 14
```

### Save z-score matrix from gctx file to HDF5 file 

Read in the large z-score matrix of signatures after filter from the gctx file by chunks
and write the matrix to an HDF5 file, which is the LINCS database.
Since the size of the matrix would be tens of gigabytes, 
it will consume all the memories of a laptop if reading the 
full matrix at once. Reading the matrix by chunks and append to an HDF5 file will 
be memory efficient. 

We also provide the utility to read in subset of a large matrix in HDF5 file as 
`SummarizedExperiment` object by chunks/indexing.
```{r extract_modz, eval=FALSE}
gctx="./data/GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_Level5_COMPZ.MODZ_n473647x12328.gctx"
gctx2h5(gctx, cid=meta42_filter$sig_id, new_cid=meta42_filter$pert_cell_factor,
        h5file="./data/lincs.h5", chunksize=5000, overwrite=TRUE)
se <- readHDF5chunk(h5file="./data/lincs.h5", colindex=1:5000)
```

# `lincs_expr` signature database

The LINCS Level3 expression database was downloaded at [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE92742).
It contains normalized expression values of 12328 genes from 1.3 million
treatment and control samples (compound treatments in different cells at various
concentration and duration, including replicates as well as genetic perturbations). 
The same as the LINCS database, the level3 signatures were filtered by selecting
compound treatments at specific concentration and duration. 
The mean expression values was calculated for replicated samples that are treated by the same
compound in the same cell type with selected concentration and treatment time.
Then the mean expression matrix was written to an HDF5 file, which is the `lincs_expr`
database. It contains mean gene expression values from 5,925 compound treatment samples 
in 30 cells (38,824 signatures in total). 

## Load from `AnnotationHub`
The preprocessed `lincs_expr` database can be loaded through the `AnnotationHub` interface
```{r lincs_expr, eval=FALSE}
library(AnnotationHub)
ah <- AnnotationHub()
query(ah, c("signatureSearchData", "lincs_expr"))
lincs_expr_path <- ah[['AH69093']]
```

## Generate from the original resources

### Download the LINCS Level3 datasets at GEO 

Download the following files from [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE92742):

+ GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_Level3_INF_mlr12k_n1319138x12328.gctx.gz
+ GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_gene_info.txt.gz
+ GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_inst_info.txt.gz

Unzip the downloaded files to the `data` directory under the present working 
directory of the userâ€™s R session.

### Filter signatures 

Filter the LINCS level3 signatures for compound treatments at 10 uM and 24 h
```{r filter_expr, eval=FALSE}
inst42 <- readr::read_tsv("./data/GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_inst_info.txt") 
inst42_filter <- inst_filter(inst42, pert_type="trt_cp", dose=10, dose_unit="um", 
                             time=24, time_unit="h") # 169,795 X 13
```

### Calculate mean expression value and write the expression matrix to HDF5 file

Calculate mean expression values of replicated samples and write the mean 
expression matrix to an HDF5 file, which is the `lincs_expr` database
```{r extract_expr, eval=FALSE}
# It takes some time
meanExpr2h5(gctx="./data/GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_Level3_INF_mlr12k_n1319138x12328.gctx",
            inst=inst42_filter, h5file="./data/lincs_expr.h5") # 12328 X 38824
```

# `cmap_rank` signature database

The CMap group has pre-processed a `rankMatrix` storing the ranks of probe sets 
for each instance (a treatment and control pair and the probe sets were ordered 
by their extent of differential expression between this treatment and control pair).
Since the CMap instances contain compound treatments in cells at multiple concentration
and treatment time, they were filtered by selecting only one instance of a 
compound treatment in a cell to get gene rank profiles of compound treatments in cells.
The probe sets were transformed to gene levels by taking mean value of ranks of
probes representing the same gene. The resulting `cmap_rank` database contains 
rank profiles of 12,403 genes from 1,281 compound treatments in 5 cells 
(3,478 signatures in total). It can be used to calculate the connectivity scores 
to the query gene sets by `gess_cmap` method in the `signatureSearch` package.

## Load from `AnnotationHub`
The preprocessed `cmap_rank` database can be loaded through the `AnnotationHub` interface
```{r cmap_rank, eval=FALSE}
library(AnnotationHub)
ah <- AnnotationHub()
query(ah, c("signatureSearchData", "cmap_rank"))
cmap_rank_path <- ah[["AH69763"]]
```

## Generate from the original resources

### Download the `rankMatrix` from [CMap 02](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/cmap)

Download the [rankMatrix.txt.zip](ftp://ftp.broad.mit.edu/pub/cmap/rankMatrix.txt.zip)
and unzip it to the `data` directory under the present working directory of the userâ€™s R session.

### Filter instances
Selecting only one instance of a compound treatment in a cell.
```{r filter_rankm, eval=FALSE}
path <- system.file("extdata", "cmap_instances_02.txt", package="signatureSearchData")
cmap_inst <- read.delim(path, check.names=FALSE) 
inst_id <- cmap_inst$instance_id[!duplicated(paste(cmap_inst$cmap_name, cmap_inst$cell2, sep="_"))]
rankM <- read.delim("./data/rankMatrix.txt", check.names=FALSE, row.names=1)
rankM_sub <- rankM[,as.character(inst_id)]
colnames(rankM_sub) <- unique(paste(cmap_inst$cmap_name, cmap_inst$cell2, "trt_cp", sep="__"))
```

###  Transform probe set to gene level data

#### Obtain annotation information
The following generates annotation information for the Affymetirx probe set
identifiers. Note, the three different Affymetrix chip types used by CMap
share most probe set ids (>95%), meaning it is possible to use the same 
annotation package.
```{r affyid_annot, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(hgu133a.db)
myAnnot <- data.frame(ACCNUM=sapply(contents(hgu133aACCNUM), paste, collapse=", "), 
                      SYMBOL=sapply(contents(hgu133aSYMBOL), paste, collapse=", "), 
                      UNIGENE=sapply(contents(hgu133aUNIGENE), paste, collapse=", "), 
                      ENTREZID=sapply(contents(hgu133aENTREZID), paste, collapse=", "), 
                      ENSEMBL=sapply(contents(hgu133aENSEMBL), paste, collapse=", "), 
                      DESC=sapply(contents(hgu133aGENENAME), paste, collapse=", "))
saveRDS(myAnnot, "./data/myAnnot.rds")
```

#### Transform probe sets to genes
The probe sets were transformed to gene levels by taking mean value of ranks of
probes representing the same gene.
```{r mr_prob, eval=FALSE}
rankM_sub_gene <- probe2gene(rankM_sub, myAnnot) # It takes some time
```

### Write the processed rank matrix to an HDF5 file

Write the processed CMap rank matrix to an HDF5 file, which is the `cmap_rank` database
```{r cmap_rank2h5, eval=FALSE}
matrix2h5(rankM_sub_gene, "./data/cmap_rank.h5", overwrite=TRUE) # 12403 X 3587
rhdf5::h5ls("./data/cmap_rank.h5")
## Read in cmap_rank.h5 as SummarizedExperiment object by chunks
cmap_rank_se <- readHDF5chunk("./data/cmap_rank.h5", colindex=1:5)
```

# `cmap_expr` signature database
For correlation based GESS methods (`gess_cor`) in the `signatureSearch` software 
package, the signature database containing gene expression intensity values of drug 
treatment samples could also be used to search for similarity when the query
signature are also gene expression values. 

The `cmap_expr` database was created from the raw CEL files generated by scanning
Affymetrix microarrays. The source data was downloaded from the 
[Connectivity Map website](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/cmap/).
The downloaded CEL files were normalized by `MAS5` method. 
Then, the expression values of drug treatment samples at different 
concentration, duration were averaged and used as expression values of that drug
treatment in a cell. The expression matrix was then saved in an HDF5 file, which
is the `cmap_expr` database. It represents mean expression values of 1,309 drug
treatment samples in 5 cells (3,587 signatures in total).

## Load from `AnnotationHub`
The preprocessed `cmap_expr` database is stored in an HDF5 file and can be 
loaded through the `AnnotationHub` interface
```{r cmap_expr, eval=FALSE}
library(AnnotationHub)
ah <- AnnotationHub()
query(ah, c("signatureSearchData", "cmap_expr"))
cmap_expr_path <- ah[["AH69091"]]
```

## Generate from the original resources

### Create expected directory structure
The following creates the expected directory structure. Input data will be 
stored in the data directory and results will be written to the results 
directory. All paths are given relative to the present working directory of 
the userâ€™s R session.
```{r work_envir, eval=FALSE}
dir.create("data"); dir.create("data/CEL"); dir.create("results") 
```

### Download data from Connectivity Map project site
The drug-related expression data are downloaded from the 
[CMap website](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap). The `getCmapCEL` function
downloads the 7,056 CEL files. The functions will write the
downloaded files to the `data/CEL` directories within the present 
working directory of the user's R session. Since some of the raw data sets 
are large, the functions will only rerun the download if the argument `rerun` 
is assigned `TRUE`. If the raw data are not needed then users can skip this 
time consuming download step and work with the preprocessed database loaded from 
the `AnnotationHub`.

```{r download_cmap, eval=FALSE}
getCmapCEL(rerun=FALSE) # Download cmap CEL files. this will take hours
```

The experimental design of the CMap project is defined in the file
`cmap_instances_02.xls`.  Note, this file required some cleaning in LibreOffice
(Excel would work for this too). After this it was saved as tab delimited txt
file named `cmap_instances_02.txt`. It is available from this package.
```{r cmap_inst2, eval=TRUE}
path <- system.file("extdata", "cmap_instances_02.txt", package="signatureSearchData")
cmap_inst <- read.delim(path, check.names=FALSE) 
```

The panel of cell lines used by CMAP includes 
[MCF7](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/help_topics_linkified.jsp#mcf7), 
[ssMCF7](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/help_topics_linkified.jsp#mcf7), 
[HL60](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/help_topics_linkified.jsp#hl60), 
[PC3](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/help_topics_linkified.jsp#pc3) and 
[SKMEL5](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/help_topics_linkified.jsp#skmel5). 

### Determine chip type from CEL files 
The CMAP data set is based on three different Affymetrix chip types (HG-U133A,
HT_HG-U133A and U133AAofAv2). The following extracts the chip type information
from the CEL files and stores the result in an `rds` file with the path 
`./data/chiptype.rds`.

```{r get_cel_type, eval=FALSE}
library(affxparser)
celfiles <- list.files("./data/CEL", pattern=".CEL$")
chiptype <- sapply(celfiles, function(x) affxparser::readCelHeader(paste0("data/CEL/", x))$chiptype)
saveRDS(chiptype, "./data/chiptype.rds")
```

### Normalization of CEL files

The following processes the CEL files from each chip type separately using the
MAS5 normalization algorithm. The results will be written to 3 subdirectores
under `data` that are named after the chip type names. Since thousands of CEL 
files could not be read into memory at once, they are normalized in batch
by processing 200 files at once. The normalization process takes about 10 hours, 
to save time, the process can be easily paralleled on a computer cluster with 
a scheduler (e.g. Slurm).

The number of CEL files from each chip type are: 807 CEL files from HG-U133A, 
6029 CEL files from HT_HG-U133A, and 220 CEL files from U133AAofAv2. 
Note, these numbers are slightly different than those reported in the 
`cmap_instances_02.txt` file. 

```{r normalize_chips, eval=FALSE}
chiptype <- readRDS("./data/chiptype.rds")
chiptype_list <- split(names(chiptype), as.character(chiptype))
normalizeCel(chiptype_list, batchsize=200, rerun=FALSE) # it takes about 10 hours
```

Combine results from same chip type in single data frame, then combine the data
frame from different chip types into `mas5df`
```{r comb_chip_type_data, eval=FALSE}
chiptype_dir <- unique(chiptype)
combineResults(chiptype_dir, rerun=FALSE)
mas5df <- combineNormRes(chiptype_dir, norm_method="MAS5")
```

### Transform probe set to gene level data
Copy the `myAnnot.rds` generated from the above "cmap_rank signature database" 
section to the `data` directory under your current R session
```{r prof2gene, eval=FALSE}
myAnnot <- readRDS("./data/myAnnot.rds") 
mas5df <- probe2gene(mas5df, myAnnot) # It takes about 15 minutes
saveRDS(mas5df,"./data/mas5df.rds")
```

### Take mean expression values of drug treatment samples

Take mean expression values of multiple drug treatment samples at different 
concentration and duration in the same cell as expression value of that drug
treatment in the cell.
```{r rma2cmap_expr, eval=FALSE}
mas5df <- readRDS("./data/mas5df.rds") # matrix: 12403 7056
path <- system.file("extdata", "cmap_instances_02.txt", package="signatureSearchData")
cmap_inst <- read.delim(path, check.names=FALSE) 
cmap_drug_cell_expr <- meanExpr(mas5df, cmap_inst) # 12403 X 3587
saveRDS(cmap_drug_cell_expr, "./data/cmap_drug_cell_expr.rds")
```

### Store the expression matrix to an HDF5 file
```{r gen_cmap_expr, eval=FALSE}
cmap_drug_cell_expr <- readRDS("./data/cmap_drug_cell_expr.rds")
## match colnames to '(drug)__(cell)__(factor)' format
colnames(cmap_drug_cell_expr) <- gsub("(^.*)_(.*$)", "\\1__\\2__trt_cp", 
                                      colnames(cmap_drug_cell_expr)) 
matrix2h5(cmap_drug_cell_expr, "./data/cmap_expr.h5", overwrite=TRUE)
## Read in cmap_expr.h5 by chunks
cmap_expr_se <- readHDF5chunk("./data/cmap_expr.h5", colindex=1:5)
```

# Discussion
The `lincs`, `lincs_expr`, `cmap_rank`, and `cmap_expr` signature databases we
generated above contain genome-wide expression profiles of drug treatments in
cells. The profile could be z-scores from differential expression analysis, gene
ranks, expression intensity values from microarray, log transformed read counts 
from RNA-seq *etc*. Users can also build their custom signature database via 
`build_custom_db` function in the `signatureSearch` software package. 

The signature database is technology independent, the profiles could be from
Affymetrix chips, L1000 assay, RNA-seq or other gene expression profiling 
technology. The treatments could be any of bioactive small molecules, genetic 
perturbations, disease state *etc*.

For the CMap dataset, the MAS5 normalized expression data could also be used for
DE analysis, the resulting scores (e.g. log2 fold change) can be used to build
the `cmap` signature database used for all the GESS methods in the 
`signatureSearch` package. The details is under the "Supplement" section.

# Other datasets
This annotation package also contains other intermediate datasets used for
functionality in the `signatureSearch` software package, 
such as getting targets of query drugs in [DrugBank](https://www.drugbank.ca/), 
[CLUE](https://clue.io/) and [STITCH](http://stitch.embl.de/) databases, 
conducting GO enrichment analysis or computing WTCS p-values or tau scores of the
`gess_lincs` method in the `signatureSearch` package. 

# Supplement

## `cmap` signature database
The MAS5 normalized CEL files from the "cmap_expr signature database" section
can be used for DE analysis with `limma` package to get the `logMA` matrix 
containing the log2 fold change scores. The treatment v.s. control instances 
were defined in the `cmap_instances_02.txt`. The `logMA` matrix was stored in an 
HDF5 file, which is the `cmap` database. It represents the $log_2$ fold change 
(log2FC) scores of 12,403 genes from 1,281 compound treatments in 5 cells 
(3,478 signatures in total).

### Load from `AnnotationHub`
The preprocessed `cmap` database can be loaded through the `AnnotationHub` interface
```{r cmap, eval=FALSE}
library(AnnotationHub)
ah <- AnnotationHub()
query(ah, c("signatureSearchData", "cmap"))
cmap_expr_path <- ah[["AH69090"]]
```

### Generate from the original resources
Use the same working directory as `cmap_expr` signature database.

#### Generate list of CEL names defining treatment vs. control comparisons

The `sampleList` function extracts the sample comparisons (contrasts) from the
CMAP annotation table and stores them as a list.
```{r cel_file_list, eval=FALSE}
path <- system.file("extdata", "cmap_instances_02.txt", package="signatureSearchData")
cmap_inst <- read.delim(path, check.names=FALSE) 
comp_list <- sampleList(cmap_inst, myby="CMP_CELL")
```

#### DEG analysis with `limma`
The analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is performed with the `limma` package.
```{r deg_limma, eval=FALSE}
mas5df <- readRDS("./data/mas5df.rds")
degList <- runLimma(df=log2(mas5df), comp_list, fdr=0.10, foldchange=1, verbose=TRUE)
saveRDS(degList, "./results/degList.rds") # saves entire degList
```

#### Store the `logMA` into an HDF5 file
The `logMA` contains the log2FC scores of drug treatments in cells. It is saved
to an HDF5 file, which is the `cmap` database.
```{r se, eval=FALSE}
degList <- readRDS("./results/degList.rds")
logMA <- degList$logFC
