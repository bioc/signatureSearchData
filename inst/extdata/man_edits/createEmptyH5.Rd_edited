\description{
This function can be used to create an empty HDF5 file where the user defines
the file path and compression level. The empty HDF5 file has under its root
group three data slots named 'assay', 'colnames' and 'rownames' for storing a
\code{numeric matrix} along with its column names (\code{character}) and row names
(\code{character}), respectively.
}
\examples{
tmp_file <- tempfile(fileext=".h5")
createEmptyH5(tmp_file, level=6)
}
